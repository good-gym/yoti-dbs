<h1>Get your first mission</h1>
<p>It's great that you want to join our community of runners who get fit while doing good.</p>
<p>Your first mission run, if you choose to accept it, is to take your proof of identity to one of our meeting points.</p>
<p>When you get there, one of our team members will help you with your DBS check, so you can start taking on real-life missions.</p>
